Developed by M.Mazzarini

This code is done to analyse astrophysical simulation outputs from Gadget 2 (Springel, V. 2005 MNRAS, 364, 1105) and Gadget-4 (Springel, V., Pakmor, R., Zier
O., Reinecke, M., https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03567) 

The code is in C++ and is composite of more source files. 
This repository contains a Makefile.

To create the executable, access the Makefile and make sure the required libraries and their paths are correctly linked. 

Requirements:
