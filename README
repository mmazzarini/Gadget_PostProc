Gadget_PostProc 

Developed (2017-18) by Matteo Mazzarini @ARI, Heidelberg, Germany

This code is done to analyse astrophysical N-body simulation outputs from Gadget 2 ("Springel, V. 2005 MNRAS, 364, 1105") and Gadget-4 ("Springel, V., Pakmor, R., Zier
O., Reinecke, M., https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03567") 
Gadget_PostProc is used to study the distribution properties of matter in simulation snapshots containing 1 Milky Way-like galaxy model (consisting of stellar disc, 
stellar bulge and dark matter halo) and additional satellite galaxy models made of stars and dark matter particles. 

The code is in C++ and is composite of many source files. Gadget_PostProc reads the HDF5 data from Gadget simulations and finds the density centre of the 
system (following the method of Peter Berczik). By means of a rotation of the system, aligning it to the angular momentum of the 
galactic disc, it then calculates tidal masses and tidal radii of the satellite galaxies, the quantity of stripped matter from the satellites and other kinematic
and positional properties of matter inside the simulation, including the second order momenta tensor for the geometry of the analysed components.

Requirements:
- HDF5 library
- C++ compiler, standard C++11

This repository contains a Makefile, as well as the Gadget_PostProc_Makefile_Setup.sh file to set the HDF5 environmental variables used to compile the code.

The code written for compilation and execution on Unix-based shells and terminals.

To create the executable, go on the terminal and:

1 - run $./Gadget_PostProc_Makefile_Setup.sh, modifying inside it the path to the HDF5 modules;
2 - run $make; an execuable with a name corresponding to the one of the variable $EXEC will be created;
3 - run your executable as ./name_of_executable.

Input snapshot files should be stored as "root_snapshot_"+NNN+".hdf5", with NNN the snapshot number in 3 digits, and with "root" the root of the snapshot filename.

The code asks at the beginning some input parameters (filename "root", initial snapshot, final snapshot, snapshot step, number of satellites, concentration parameter 
of the Milky Way model, x-y-z resolutions for 2D maps and softening/resolution for all particle types to determine the centre of maass).

The code requires an Aquarius-simulations table containing information about the initial satellite tidal and scale radii and tidal masses of the satellites used in the simulation
(for information about the table, see "Moetazedian R, and Just A. 2016, MNRAS, 459, 2905", and "Mazzarini M., Just A., Macci√≤ A. V., Moetazedian R., 2020, A&A, 636, A106").

The code returns a "_postProc.hdf5" file, in HDF5 format, for each analysed snapshot, containing all the information about the reduced data.
